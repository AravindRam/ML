# Machine Learning for Data Informatics

This repository contains couple of assignments and a project as part of the Machine Learning coursework.

**HW2** - Contains the homework description, source code, sample input and output for the implementation of K Means Clustering Algorithm in Python

**HW3** - Contains the homework description, source code, sample input and output for the implementation of Adaboost Algorithm in Python

**Project** - Contains the code implementation of the 4 Machine Learning Algorithms (namely Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and Adaboost) used to build a model to predict the crime happening in San Francisco. The project is part of the Kaggle competition. The training and testing dataset provided by Kaggle was used for building the model.
